ALPS - A Language for Process Specification

This language was developed for representing manufacturing process plans, and is thoroughly documented in the following papers:

"[ALPS - A Language for Process Specification](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxpbnRlcm9wZXJhYmlsaXR5Y29uc3VsdGluZ3xneDozZjQ4ZTQxNTBiZDhjY2Rl)," International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, special issue on Process Planning and Design for Manufacture, 4, #2, pp. 105, 1991.

"[Using the ALPS Process Plan Model](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxpbnRlcm9wZXJhYmlsaXR5Y29uc3VsdGluZ3xneDo2MjBjMTNlMDljMzcwOWZm)," Proceedings of the ASME Manufacturing International Conference, Dallas, Texas, March 1992.

The original model has been re-coded in the SHACL language.
